          Hardware and VLSI projects are hard to find. Unlike software, which is
          flooded with tutorials and open-source projects, VLSI design requires
          structured guidance, domain expertise, and access to real-world
          design methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          VLSI Dojo bridges this gap with resume-ready, step-by-step project
          guides that take you from concept to implementation. Whether you’re a
          beginner or aiming for advanced processor design, we’ve got you
          covered.
